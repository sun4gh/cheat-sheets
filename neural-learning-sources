Len and Arrays

>>> train_data.shape
(60000, 28, 28)
>>> len(train_data)
60000

>>> myList = [ 'a', 'b', 'c']
>>> len(myList)
3
>>> anotherList = np.zeros( (2,3))
>>> anotherList
array([[0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0.]])
>>> len(anotherList)
2

- if you're not familiar with python, or the conventiont that numpy is imported as np, this will be confusing
- on the other hand, there's an introduction to python as part of the same article series
- you need to undestand things like "dimension" - which are not explained in this article, but possibly in the prev - will review
