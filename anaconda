UPDATING CONDA

UPDATING ALL


WHERE ANACONDA STORES ENV?
$ conda info --envs
# conda environments:
#
base                  *  /anaconda3
newenv                   /anaconda3/envs/newenv

WORKING WITH ENVs YOU ALREADY HAVE

To activate in a terminal session:
$ conda activate the_env
To see the packages of the current env (and their version)  :
$ conda list


INSTALL PACKAGE:
- do you need to clone a current env first so you can work in a new env?
- in AN check if it's already installed; or use the uninstalled choice in the drop down to find it easily

Option:
In terminal activate the environment you want to use.

Search for the package, e.g. librosa:
$ conda search librosa
if that fails, user top search field in anaconda.org to find the pacakage, then look at the instructions on that page, e.g.
$ conda install -c conda-forge librosa
