Since everything in Python is an Object, every variable holds an object instance. When an object is initiated, it is assigned a unique object id. 

Simple put, a mutable object can be changed after it is created, and an immutable object can't. Objects of built-in types like (int, float, bool, str, tuple, unicode) are immutable. Objects of built-in types like (list, set, dict) are mutable. Custom classes are generally mutable.

Immutable objects are fundamentally expensive to “change”, because doing so involves creating a copy. Changing mutable objects is cheap.
