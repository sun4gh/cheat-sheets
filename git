CREATE LOCAL DIR BEFORE CLONE?
Cloning will create a parent directory for the repo, inside of which there will be the .git repo, and the working files
Navigate to the parent directory of your choice, to execute:
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
this will create a directory whose name is the repo you're cloning.

RENAME A REPO
Rename on github, then re-clone on the local.

MERGING
Merge changes on github to local repo
  git pull
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull

""" (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8746631/what-happens-when-i-do-git-pull-origin-master-in-the-develop-branch)
	git pull origin master
pulls the master branch from the remote called origin into your current branch. It only affects your current branch, not your local master branch.
essentially a combination of 
	git fetch
and
	git merge
"""

BRANCHES
	git branch
gives you a list of branches

	git -d a-specific-branch
will delete it. You might need to override complaint using -D instead of -d

Deleted a branch that wasn't merged?
	git reflog
then, find the SHA1 for the commit at the tip of your deleted branch, then just 
	git checkout [sha]
And once you're at that commit, you can just git checkout -b [branchname] to recreate the branch from there.


FIX WRONG EMAIL USERNAME
(from https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/change-author-name-email)

run this from prompt
$ git filter-branch --env-filter '
WRONG_EMAIL="wrong@example.com"
NEW_NAME="New Name Value"
NEW_EMAIL="correct@example.com"

if [ "$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL" = "$WRONG_EMAIL" ]
then
    export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$NEW_NAME"
    export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$NEW_EMAIL"
fi
if [ "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" = "$WRONG_EMAIL" ]
then
    export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="$NEW_NAME"
    export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="$NEW_EMAIL"
fi
' --tag-name-filter cat -- --branches --tags

(Note: if you get a warning about a backup already existing, add the flag -f after filter-branch)

THEN

git push --force --tags origin 'refs/heads/*'
