CREATE LOCAL DIR BEFORE CLONE?
Cloning will create a parent directory for the repo, inside of which there will be the .git repo, and the working files
Navigate to the parent directory of your choice, to execute:
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
this will create a directory whose name is the repo you're cloning.

RENAME A REPO
Rename on github, then re-clone on the local.

MERGING
Merge changes on github to local repo
  git pull
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull

	git pull origin master
pulls the master branch from the remote called origin into your current branch. It only affects your current branch, not your local master branch.
essentially a combination of 
	git fetch
and
	git merge
